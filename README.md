# JACS - JAnelia Computational Services

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-compute.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-compute)

JACS is both a framework and a collection of computational services for scientific computing at Janelia. It currently includes:

  - asynchronous RESTful services for running jobs on clusters
  - synchronous RESTful services for accessing metadata about domain objects 
  - a [data model](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-model) for managing metadata surrounding image processing 
  - [Docker packaging](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-cm) for deploying the JACS services

See [Getting Started](docs/GettingStarted.md) to learn about building and deploying the code.
