# JACS - JAnelia Computational Services

[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-compute/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-compute/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

JACS is both a framework and a collection of computational services for scientific computing at Janelia. It currently includes:

  - asynchronous RESTful services for running jobs on clusters 
  - synchronous RESTful services for accessing metadata about domain objects 
  - a [data model](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-model) for managing metadata surrounding image processing 
  - [Docker packaging](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-cm) for deploying the JACS services

See [Getting Started](docs/GettingStarted.md) to learn about building and deploying the code.
